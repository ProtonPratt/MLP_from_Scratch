    "### Report on Categorical Data in the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This report provides an overview of the categorical columns present in the dataset, along with insights derived from the summary statistics. The dataset consists of 1,000 samples and includes various features related to demographics, purchasing behavior, and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categorical Columns Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The following categorical columns are present in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gender**\n",
    "2. **Education**\n",
    "3. **Married**\n",
    "4. **City**\n",
    "5. **Occupation**\n",
    "6. **Most Bought Item**\n",
    "7. **Labels**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Gender\n",
    "- **Type**: Binary (0 = Female, 1 = Male)\n",
    "- **Mean**: 0.494\n",
    "- **Distribution**: Approximately equal representation of genders, with a slight inclination towards females (0) and males (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Education\n",
    "- **Type**: Ordinal (0 = No education, 1 = Primary, 2 = Secondary, 3 = Tertiary)\n",
    "- **Mean**: 1.534\n",
    "- **Distribution**: The majority of individuals have completed primary or secondary education, with fewer individuals having tertiary education.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Married\n",
    "- **Type**: Binary (0 = Not Married, 1 = Married)\n",
    "- **Mean**: 0.490\n",
    "- **Distribution**: The dataset is evenly split between married and unmarried individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. City\n",
    "- **Type**: Continuous numerical representation (could represent city IDs or some metric)\n",
    "- **Mean**: 483.397\n",
    "- **Range**: Cities range from 0 to 968.\n",
    "- **Insights**: This variable may require further categorization or encoding for effective analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Occupation\n",
    "- **Type**: Ordinal/Discrete (0 to 10 representing different occupations)\n",
    "- **Mean**: 5.090\n",
    "- **Distribution**: Occupations are varied, with a mean indicating a mid-range occupation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Most Bought Item\n",
    "- **Type**: Discrete numerical representation (item IDs or counts)\n",
    "- **Mean**: 11.505\n",
    "- **Range**: Items range from 0 to 23.\n",
    "- **Insights**: This feature may indicate popular purchasing trends among consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Labels\n",
    "- **Type**: Continuous numerical representation (could represent target variables for regression or classification)\n",
    "- **Mean**: 194.313\n",
    "- **Range**: Labels range from 0 to 396.\n",
    "- **Insights**: This variable likely serves as a target for predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights and Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gender Balance**:\n",
    "   - The dataset appears to have a balanced representation of genders, which is beneficial for generalizing findings across different gender groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Educational Attainment**:\n",
    "   - A significant portion of the population has at least primary education, indicating a relatively educated sample group.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Marital Status Representation**:\n",
    "   - The near-equal distribution of married and unmarried individuals allows for comparative studies on purchasing behavior based on marital status.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **City Representation**:\n",
    "   - The continuous nature of the city variable suggests that it may need further categorization or transformation before analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Occupation Diversity**:\n",
    "   - The variety in occupations provides an opportunity to explore how different job roles influence consumer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Purchasing Behavior Insights**:\n",
    "   - The \"Most Bought Item\" feature can be analyzed to understand consumer preferences and trends in purchasing behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Label Distribution for Target Variable**:\n",
    "   - The labels column will be critical for any predictive modeling efforts and should be examined for distribution characteristics to ensure appropriate modeling techniques are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains valuable categorical information that can provide insights into consumer behavior based on demographic factors such as gender, education, marital status, city, and occupation. Further analysis should focus on how these categorical variables interact with purchasing behaviors and the target labels for predictive modeling purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding) for use in machine learning models.\n",
    "2. Explore relationships between categorical features and purchasing behavior through visualizations.\n",
    "3. Conduct further statistical analysis to identify significant predictors among categorical variables for the target labels.\n",
    "4. Ensure that any continuous variables are appropriately categorized if they represent nominal data (e.g., city)."
